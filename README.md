# ♻️ LC Routing Project

The **LC Routing Project** is a web-based tool designed to analyze, compare, and optimize logistics routes for landfill and haul operations. Users can upload CSV files containing stop data and landfill information, visualize routes, and generate optimized paths for improved efficiency in waste collection and transportation.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload and analyze **CSV files** for stops and landfill sites
* Visual **route selection** interface for user-friendly interaction
* **Route optimization** at the click of a button
* **Compare** actual and optimized routes side-by-side
* Detailed breakdown of each route segment
* **DRT to SWG** conversion toggle available

---

## 📂 Input Data

The app requires two CSV files:

1. **Stops Array CSV** – Contains a list of route stops to be analyzed
2. **Haul and Landfill CSV** – Contains landfill and haul site information

> These files should come from a prior data transformation process.

---

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Open the web interface by navigating to the service URL.
2. Upload the **Stops Array CSV** and **Landfill CSV** files.
3. After a successful upload, select a route from the interface.
4. Click **"Optimize Route"** to generate a new optimized route.
5. Use **"Compare Routes"** to view differences between actual and optimized paths.
6. Scroll down to view **detailed segment information**.
7. If supported, toggle **DRT to SWG** conversion as needed.
